# GraphConn

This library serves as a communication layer between HIRO engine and ActionHandler on one side,
and HIRO Graph server on the other.

## Installation

Import library as dependency using git path (and optional tag/branch):

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:graph_conn, git: "git@github.com:arago/graph_conn.git", tag: "latest"}
  ]
end
```

## Telemetry

Sends telemetry events:
_ `[:graph_conn, :ws_upgrade], %{time, duration}, %{node, success}`
_ `[:graph_conn, :ws_down], %{time}, %{node}`
_ `[:graph_conn, :ws_lost_connection], %{time}, %{node}`
_ `[:graph_conn, :ws_sent_bytes], %{time, duration, bytes}, %{node}`
_ `[:graph_conn, :ws_received_bytes], %{time, bytes}, %{node}`
_ `[:graph_conn, :rest], %{time, duration, bytes_sent, bytes_received}, %{node, path, method, status_code}`

`time` is in UTC, `success` is boolean, `duration` is in ms, `bytes` is number of bytes sent or recieved.

## Mock Graph server

This library behaves as an application in `dev` env, mocking graph server so AH can connect to it and accept requests.

`docker-compose.yaml` describes both AH and mock graph server, so once compose is up, AH will connect to mock graph server.
You can attach to running mock graph server session in order to invoke actions on AH.

Note: If you plan to use `ExecuteCommand` or any other `ssh` based capability, make sure to add `ssh-keys/id_rsa.pub`
into servers `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file. To ssh to host machine:

```
cat ssh-keys/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

### Setup

1. Make sure that capability is configured in `config/dev.exs`

2. Build and Run docker compose:

```
docker compose build && \
docker compose up
```

3. Attach to the running mock graph

```
$ docker exec -ti hiro-graph-mock bash
$ iex --remsh mock
```

4. Invoke command from running iex session

#### Echo action

```
iex> params = %{"other_handler" => "Echo", "command" => "ls", "sleep" => 40, "timeout" => 2}
iex> ActionInvoker.execute(params)
```

#### SSH action

```
iex> params = %{"command" => "hostname", "host" => "<ssh-server-name>", "user" => "<username>", "timeout" => 5}
iex> ActionInvoker.execute("ExecuteCommand", params)
```

#### HTTP action

```
iex> params = %{"url" => "https://example.com", "timeout" => 5}
iex> ActionInvoker.execute("HTTPRequest", params)
```

## Test

Run `mix test` to run ActionInvoker and ActionHandler tests against local mock server. For tests running through Graph create `config/git_ignored.exs` file and set with correct credentials:

```
import Config

config :graph_conn, GraphConn.TestConn,
  url: "https://ec2-63-33-203-84.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8443",
  insecure: true,
  auth: [
    credentials: [
      client_id: "<CLIENT_ID>",
      client_secret: "<CLIENT_SECRET>",
      username: "<USERNAME>",
      password: "<PASSWORD>"
    ]
  ]

config :graph_conn, GraphConn.Test.ActionHandler,
  url: "https://ec2-63-33-203-84.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8443",
  insecure: true,
  auth: [
    credentials: [
      client_id: "<AH_CLIENT_ID>",
      client_secret: "<AH_CLIENT_SECRET>",
      username: "<AH_USERNAME>",
      password: "<AH_PASSWORD>"
    ]
  ]
```

and then run

```
INTEGRATION_TESTS=true mix test
```

## Usage

### Define your Conn module

```elixir
defmodule MyConn do
  use GraphConn, otp_app: :graph_conn
  require Logger

  def on_status_change(new_status, _) do
    Logger.debug("New status for main connection is: #{inspect(new_status)}")
  end

  def on_status_change(api, new_status, _) do
    Logger.debug("New status for #{api} connection is: #{inspect(new_status)}")
  end

  def handle_message(api, msg, _) do
    Logger.debug("Received new message #{inspect(msg)} from #{api}")
  end
end
```

### Start connection

Connection can be started either manually or preferably as a part of supervision tree:

```elixir
def start(_, _) do
  children = [
    {MyConn, [:from_config]},
    # ... other children
  ]

  opts = [strategy: :one_for_one]
  Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
end
```

### Configuration

Set Graph server details

```elixir
config :graph_conn, MyConn,
  host: "example.com",
  port: 8443,
  insecure: true,
  credentials: [
    client_id: "client_id",
    client_secret: "client_secret",
    password: "password%",
    username: "me@arago.de"
  ]
```

For communication with Graph server with REST calls we use pool of connections.

### Invoke call

Once connection is started, it will pick api versions from Graph server and authenticate
using `:credentials` from configuration. When everything is ready, `on_status_change/2` callback
will be invoked with `new_status = :ready`.

Current connection status can be also checked explicitly:

```elixir
:ready = MyConn.status()
```

Prepare request and execute it against some api (`:action` in this case).

```elixir
config_id = "my_config_id"
request = %GraphConn.Request{
  path: "app/#{config_id}/handlers"
}
{:ok, %GraphConn.Response{} = response} = MyConn.execute(:action, request)
```

## Documentation

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc):

`$> mix docs`

## Tests

Tests can be run against integrated Mock server or against real Graph server (configured in config/config.exs).

By default tests are run against Mock server, but if system env var `INTEGRATION_TESTS=true` is set,
tests will be run against real server. When switching between those two modes on local computer,
`mix.exs` needs to be changed in order to force `.app` file recompilation.

So in order to run integration tests, start them as:

```
$> touch mix.exs && INTEGRATION_TESTS=true mix test
```

and if you want to move back to Mock server do:

```
$> touch mix.exs && mix test
```
